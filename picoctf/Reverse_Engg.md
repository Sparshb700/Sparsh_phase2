# 1. GDB baby step 1

> Can you figure out what is in the `eax` register at the end of the `main` function? Put your answer in the picoCTF flag format: `picoCTF{n}` where `n` is the contents of the `eax` register in the decimal number base. If the answer was `0x11` your flag would be `picoCTF{17}`. Disassemble [this](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/512/debugger0_a).

## Solution:

1. On downloading the binary file, I launched `gdb` ("GNU debugger") with binary file provided.
```
âžœ  babystep1 gdb debugger0_a
GNU gdb (Ubuntu 15.0.50.20240403-0ubuntu1) 15.0.50.20240403-git

(gdb)
```

2. Then I disassembled the `main` function.
```
(gdb) disas main
Dump of assembler code for function main:
   0x0000000000001129 <+0>:     endbr64
   0x000000000000112d <+4>:     push   %rbp
   0x000000000000112e <+5>:     mov    %rsp,%rbp
   0x0000000000001131 <+8>:     mov    %edi,-0x4(%rbp)
   0x0000000000001134 <+11>:    mov    %rsi,-0x10(%rbp)
   0x0000000000001138 <+15>:    mov    $0x86342,%eax
   0x000000000000113d <+20>:    pop    %rbp
   0x000000000000113e <+21>:    ret
End of assembler dump.
(gdb)
```
	From this the value stored at the `eax` register could be seen which was `0x86342`

3. Converting `0x86342` to decimal, I got `549698`, putting it in the picoCTF format, `picoCTF{549698}`

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{549698}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- Learnt the usage of GNU debugger , `gdb`

## Notes:
- Under `gdb`, `disassemble` or `disas` command can be used to look at the assembly code of a specific function

# 3. Vault Door 3
>This vault uses for-loops and byte arrays. The source code for this vault is here: [VaultDoor3.java](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/a4018cec1446761cb2e8cce05db925fa/VaultDoor3.java)

## Solve:

- Opening up the java file provided, I could see how this program asks for the password to be inputted.

Contents of `VaultDoor3.java`
```java
import java.util.*;

class VaultDoor3 {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        VaultDoor3 vaultDoor = new VaultDoor3();
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter vault password: ");
        String userInput = scanner.next();
        String input = userInput.substring("picoCTF{".length(),userInput.length()-1);
        if (vaultDoor.checkPassword(input)) {
            System.out.println("Access granted.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Access denied!");
        }
    }

    // Our security monitoring team has noticed some intrusions on some of the
    // less secure doors. Dr. Evil has asked me specifically to build a stronger
    // vault door to protect his Doomsday plans. I just *know* this door will
    // keep all of those nosy agents out of our business. Mwa ha!
    //
    // -Minion #2671
    public boolean checkPassword(String password) {
        if (password.length() != 32) {
            return false;
        }
        char[] buffer = new char[32];
        int i;
        for (i=0; i<8; i++) {
            buffer[i] = password.charAt(i);
        }
        for (; i<16; i++) {
            buffer[i] = password.charAt(23-i);
        }
        for (; i<32; i+=2) {
            buffer[i] = password.charAt(46-i);
        }
        for (i=31; i>=17; i-=2) {
            buffer[i] = password.charAt(i);
        }
        String s = new String(buffer);
        return s.equals("jU5t_a_sna_3lpm12g94c_u_4_m7ra41");
    }
}
```
- Here the string `jU5t_a_sna_3lpm12g94c_u_4_m7ra41` was to be compared with the user input put into the program to get into the `Vault`. But before that check, the user input goes through a series of changes that modified it completely.
- It changed the input like so -
	- The first 8 characters were left as it is.
	- Then next 8 characters were reversed
	- From characters 16 to 32, the characters were reversed with step of two.
	- Then the rest of the characters from 31 to 17 were also reversed the same way with the step value of two.
- To crack the real password, I created this python script that mimics the source code

Contents of `solver.py`
```python
vault = "jU5t_a_sna_3lpm12g94c_u_4_m7ra41"
passwd = ["" for x in range(32)]

for i in range(0, 8):
    passwd.insert(i, vault[i])

for i in range(8, 16):
    passwd.insert(i, vault[23-i])

for i in range(16, 32, 2):
    passwd.insert(i, vault[46-i])

for i in range(31, 16, -2):
    passwd.insert(i, vault[i])

decoded = "".join(passwd)

print("Flag: picoCTF{"+ decoded + "}")
```

- Running my program, I got the following output:`
```zsh
sparsh@LAPTOP-F80QI4V2 ~/ctf2 $ python3 solver.py
Flag: picoCTF{jU5t_a_s1mpl3_an4gr4m_4_u_c79a21}
```
## Flag:
```
picoCTF{jU5t_a_s1mpl3_an4gr4m_4_u_c79a21}
```


## Notes and Concepts Learnt:
- I already had basic knowledge of both Python and Java, so this challenge was on the easier side.
