# 1. GDB baby step 1

> Can you figure out what is in the `eax` register at the end of the `main` function? Put your answer in the picoCTF flag format: `picoCTF{n}` where `n` is the contents of the `eax` register in the decimal number base. If the answer was `0x11` your flag would be `picoCTF{17}`. Disassemble [this](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/512/debugger0_a).

## Solution:

1. On downloading the binary file, I launched `gdb` ("GNU debugger") with binary file provided.
```
➜  babystep1 gdb debugger0_a

(gdb)
```

2. Then I disassembled the `main` function.
```
(gdb) disas main
Dump of assembler code for function main:
   0x0000000000001129 <+0>:     endbr64
   0x000000000000112d <+4>:     push   %rbp
   0x000000000000112e <+5>:     mov    %rsp,%rbp
   0x0000000000001131 <+8>:     mov    %edi,-0x4(%rbp)
   0x0000000000001134 <+11>:    mov    %rsi,-0x10(%rbp)
   0x0000000000001138 <+15>:    mov    $0x86342,%eax
   0x000000000000113d <+20>:    pop    %rbp
   0x000000000000113e <+21>:    ret
End of assembler dump.
(gdb)
```
	From this the value stored at the `eax` register could be seen which was `0x86342`

3. Converting `0x86342` to decimal, I got `549698`, putting it in the picoCTF format, `picoCTF{549698}`

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{549698}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- Learnt the usage of GNU debugger , `gdb`

## Notes:
- Under `gdb`, `disassemble` or `disas` command can be used to look at the assembly code of a specific function
