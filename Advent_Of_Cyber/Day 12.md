# Phishing - `Phishmas` Greetings
## **Impersonation**
- Some attackers may act as a person, department, or even a service to lure users. This is a way to gain credibility by impersonating the recipient manager or an important person within the company.
## **Social Engineering**
- Social engineering in phishing is the art of manipulating people rather than breaking technology. Attackers craft believable stories, emails, calls, or chat messages that exploit emotions (fear, helpfulness, curiosity, urgency) and real-world context to lure the recipients of a message.
## **Typosquatting and Punycode**
- Typosquatting is when an attacker registers a common misspelling of an organisation's domain. For example, `glthub.com` instead of `github.com` (note that there is an `L` instead of an `i`).
## **Spoofing**
- Email spoofing is another way attackers can trick users into thinking they are receiving emails from a legitimate domain.
