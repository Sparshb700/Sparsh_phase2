> Phishing

## Social Engineering

**Social engineering** refers to manipulating a user to make a mistake. Examples of such mistakes include sharing a password, opening a malicious file, and approving a payment. The term “social” means that the target of such an attack is human beings, not computer systems.

## Phishing

Phishing is a subset of social engineering in which the communication medium is mostly messages. At one point, the most common phishing attacks happened via email; however, the spread of smartphones, along with ubiquitous Internet access, has spread phishing to short text messages (smishing), voice calls (vishing), QR codes (quishing), and social-media direct messages. The attacker’s purpose is to make the target user click, open, or reply to a message so that the attacker can steal information, money, or access.



## Objective 1:
**Find Password for root access**
- I had to first send a phishing mail using `setoolskit`, the process was well laid out on the website.
- After sending the phishing mail, I ran the `script.py` provided.
- The password was then leaked to the terminal
- `unranked-wisdom-anthem`

## Objective 2:
**Check if password is reused and number of toys to be shipped**
- Now I logged in to the real server and logged in as the `factory` user and the password was actually reused for this account as well.
- Now I went into unread mails, where the number of toys were mentioned to be `1984000`
- Number of Toys: `1984000`
